1. It helps to avoid having to repeat code. If somehting is going to used
a lot throughout a project this way it only needs to be written once and
multiple child classes can be reusing from a base class.

2. It creates orginization for the code to be easier to read and update. 
Because it is being used from a base class as that one gets updated, it 
will be automatically transferring these updates to the classes that are
pulling from it.
