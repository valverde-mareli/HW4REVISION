1. In the code given, the variable that change after the function call is
b. After the function calls b becomes [10, 5]. 

2. This happens as such because a is an integer which immutable ( cannot 
be changed ) so it is crating a new integer onject instead of changing.
B is different and is changing because it is a list [] which are mutable. 
It is basically updating the list which is where the change is occurring.
